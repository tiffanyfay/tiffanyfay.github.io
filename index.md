Hey! I am Tiffany and I am a technology advocate, technical content creator, and community enabler in the Cloud Native space. I most recently was a senior developer advocate at VMware. I was previously a software developer and developer advocate at Amazon, Docker, and Intel. I started off by graduating from Georgia Tech in electrical engineering. 

In my free time, I like to [travel](https://instagram.com/_tiffanyfay_) and [dabble in photography](https://instagram.com/tiffanyfayj) (I took this photo of me). You can find me on Twitter [@tiffanyfayj](https://www.twitter.com/tiffanyfayj) and everywhere else via [Linktree](https://linktr.ee/tiffanyfay).
